			<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
			<ul id="hob">
				<li>
					Video Games: I enjoy playing video games with my friends and family in my spare time. Favorite game:Witcher 3. Games currently playing: Valorant, Apex Legends, and Rocket League. I have been playing video games for as
					long as I can remember and what ultimately got me into gaming are my two older brothers who would always let me watch them play all the time. The first video game that I ever played was Sonic Adventure 2.
				</li>

				<li>
					Activities: I enjoy going to the gym and playing soccer. Soccer has always been my favorite sport. What got me into the sport was my dad. My dad was once a soccer player in Bosnia before he had to flee the country
					because of the war. When I was younger everyday after school I would go to a park where I would go practice my fundamentals with my dad. I generally go to the gym four to six times each week. I love going to the gym
					because I love pushing myself and making my body stronger everyday.
				</li>

				<li>
					Travel and Hiking: I also love to travel the world and hike. I have traveled to countries like Japan, Mexico, Bosnia, and Croatia. I also love to hike all the time with friends and family. I've hiked in places such as
					Japan, Arizona, Colorado, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.
